# malloc-allocation-tracker
A custom malloc wrapper that keeps track of allocations in an allocation list

## Why?

I was testing an application for memory leaks, and sadly I was not able to hook it to valgrind or the leak sanitizer
So I made my own
The idea behind it was that any program that uses malloc, can just be recompiles along with this static library, without the need to include or define anything

## Requirements
* gcc
* make
* ar

## Building
* Run `make`
* If all works out, the static library `libmallocwrap.a` will be created

## Using
* You will have to include `alloc_list.h` in order to be able to access to allocation list
* Compile your program with `cc yourcode.c libmallocwrap.a -ldl` *Make sure to link -ldl*
* See the `test` directory for a working example

## Issues
* The list functions are not thread safe
* The list delete function is very slow since it has to iterate through the list
* Instead of the regular libc `malloc`, `mmap` is used in the list functions
